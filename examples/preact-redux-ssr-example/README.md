# preact-redux-ssr-example

This example bases on [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) [Server-side Rendering](https://github.com/developit/preact-render-to-string) with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) Example.

And we change the source code to make it Original React compatible, so people can switch between Qreact and React as they want.
